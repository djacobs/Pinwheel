<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

<h2>1. What Pinwheel Fates Is</h2>
<p>Pinwheel Fates is an open-source, community-governed game built on the principles of
<a href="https://resonantcomputing.org">Resonant Computing</a>. It is a research project and
hackathon prototype, not a commercial product. The source code is available under the MIT license.</p>

<h2>2. Your Content Belongs to You</h2>
<p>All user-generated content — Floor proposals, votes, strategic decisions, and any other
contributions you make — belongs to you. By participating, you grant Pinwheel Fates a
non-exclusive license to display your contributions within the game and its associated Discord
server solely for the purpose of operating the game.</p>
<p>You may request deletion of your content at any time.</p>

<h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Pinwheel Fates uses AI (Claude by Anthropic) to generate reports, game commentary, and rule
interpretations. AI-generated content is provided as-is and should not be relied upon for any
purpose outside the game. The AI describes patterns — it does not prescribe actions.</p>

<h2>4. Privacy of Reports</h2>
<p>Private reports are for the player, not the developer. Your private report content is visible
only to you. It is never displayed to other players, administrators, or used for evaluation
purposes. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

<h2>5. Account and Access</h2>
<p>You sign in via Discord OAuth. We store your Discord user ID, username, and avatar URL to
identify you within the game. We do not access your Discord messages, friends list, or any
other Discord data.</p>

<h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>Floor proposals and all other user content must comply with common decency. Proposals
that contain hate speech, harassment, or illegal content will be removed. Repeated violations
will result in account suspension.</p>

<h2>7. No Warranties</h2>
<p>Pinwheel Fates is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. We do not guarantee uptime, data persistence, or uninterrupted access. This is an
experimental project — things may break, data may be reset between seasons, and features may
change without notice.</p>
<p>In no event shall the developers be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising
from the use of or inability to use the service.</p>

<h2>8. Open Source</h2>
<p>The game's source code is available under the MIT license. You are free to fork, modify, and
run your own instance. Contributions are welcome.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms as the project evolves. Material changes will be announced in the
Discord server. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>Questions about these terms? Reach out via the project's GitHub repository or Discord server.</p>
