# Pinwheel

**The game where AI doesn't play — it helps you see.**

## Philosophy

The surface of any social system is the visible behavior: the moves, the trades, the votes. The deep water is the relational structure underneath — trust, reciprocity, power, exclusion. Most groups of humans have no good tools for seeing their own social dynamics while those dynamics are happening. Democracy is ancient technology. Parliamentary procedure is centuries old. These are the rigid, inherited game mechanics of real collective life, and they've never had instrumentation.

Games are where humanity prototypes its next societies. People adhere to rules, stretch them, break them, and rebuild them — and in doing so, they rehearse the fundamental challenge of living together. Pinwheel is built on the conviction that AI's highest use is not playing the game but making the invisible dynamics of collective life visible and therefore changeable.

Drawing from David Lynch's *Catching the Big Fish*: the creative act — and the governance act — requires diving below the surface of conscious experience. The insights that matter most aren't on the surface. They live in the patterns nobody can see from inside the system. Pinwheel gives players a diving bell.

## Overview

Pinwheel is an auto-simulated 3v3 basketball league where human players don't play basketball — they govern it. Teams of co-governors shape the rules of the game through natural language proposals, interpreted by Claude Opus 4.6, and watch the consequences cascade across dozens of daily games. It starts out as basketball, but the players decide what it becomes.

The AI serves as the social system's unconscious: surfacing patterns, mirroring governance dynamics, and offering each player private reflections on their own behavior within the system. The game is most interesting when the rules are slightly unfair and everyone can see why — because that's when governance stops being abstract and becomes urgent.

## Goals

1. **Demonstrate AI as judgment amplifier.** Opus 4.6 doesn't make decisions for players. It makes the consequences of their decisions visible before, during, and after they act.
2. **Create a tight feedback loop.** Governance decisions → simulated games → visible consequences → new governance decisions. Fast enough to feel in your gut. Propose a rule, watch it cascade through a dozen games, feel the results before the next governance window.
3. **Make invisible social dynamics legible.** Coalitions forming. Power concentrating. Voices being silenced. Free-riding. The AI sees what individuals inside the system cannot.
4. **Embody resonant computing principles.** Software that is private, dedicated, plural, adaptable, and prosocial — not extractive, not surveilling, not optimizing for engagement.
5. **Be genuinely fun.** The craft and joy of the game must stand on its own. The philosophy is the skeleton; the play experience is the body.

## Resonant Computing Alignment

- **Private:** Each player's private mirror is theirs alone. The AI's reflection of your behavior, your patterns, your blind spots — visible only to you. In the era of AI, whoever controls the context holds the power. In Pinwheel, players are the primary stewards of their own context.
- **Dedicated:** The AI works exclusively for the players. No ad platform. No engagement optimization. No hidden agendas. Its only function is to make the group's own dynamics visible to the group.
- **Plural:** No single player — and not the AI itself — controls the rules. Governance is genuinely distributed. The AI can model consequences, but humans decide. Healthy ecosystems require distributed power, and Pinwheel's architecture enforces it.
- **Adaptable:** The rules are open-ended by design. Players can change game mechanics, league structure, agent behavior constraints, and even the meta-rules of governance itself. The game evolves as the community evolves.
- **Prosocial:** Playing Pinwheel practices the skill of collective self-governance. The private mirror builds self-awareness. The governance mirror builds systems awareness. The game is a rehearsal space for being better neighbors, collaborators, and stewards of shared systems.

## Hackathon Track: Amplify Human Judgment

Pinwheel augments human decision-making by making the consequences of collective choices visible at a depth and speed that unaided human perception cannot achieve. The AI never decides — it illuminates. The humans always govern.

## The Name

**Pinwheel** — from the Portland Trail Blazers logo, where five lines on each side spin around a center: the 5-on-5 in motion. A pinwheel spins when you blow on it — a small input creating continuous rotation. That's the game: a governance decision is the breath, and the simulation spins with the consequences.
